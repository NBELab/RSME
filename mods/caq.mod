This is the w-agatoxin IVA (low conc (~20 nM) blocks P, high conc (~200 nM)
blocks Q & P) sensitive current in fig 5 from Churchill - no P current.

This current does not inactivate.  Mermelstein 99 - very slow
inactivation (2 s). Churchill 98 - small-to-no inactivating component -
so ignore inactivation.



The standard HH model uses a linear approximation to the driving force
for an ion: (Vm - ez).  This is ok for na and k, but not ca - calcium
rectifies at high potentials because 
	1. internal and external concentrations of ca are so different,
	making outward current flow much more difficult than inward 
	2. calcium is divalent so rectification is more sudden than for na
	and k. (Hille 1992, pg 107)

Accordingly, we need to replace the HH formulation with the GHK model,
which accounts for this phenomenon.  The GHK equation is eq 6.6 in Koch
1998, pg 217 - it expresses Ica in terms of Ca channel permeability
(Perm,ca) times a mess. The mess can be circumvented using the ghk
function below, which is included in the Neuron share files.  Perm,ca
can be expressed in an HH-like fashion as 
	Perm,ca = pcabar * mca * mca 	(or however many m's and h's)
where pcabar has dimensions of permeability but can be thought of as max
conductance (Koch says it should be about 10^7 times smaller than the HH
gbar - dont know) and mca is analagous to m (check out Koch 1998 pg 144)

Calcium current can then be modeled as 
	ica = pcabar * mca * mca * ghk()
